  # WFB's Easy Commands Reborn
  
</div>

### **Introduction**

This is the reimagined version of [WFB's Easy Commands](https://modrinth.com/mod/wfbs-ez-commands), designed to enhance efficiency for redstone players when designing redstone machines by eliminating the need to constantly type lengthy commands.

### **Why using this mod?**

While newer Minecraft versions allow players in Creative mode to obtain administrative blocks like barriers directly from their inventory, players still need to manually type the lengthy commands to get effects, game rules, etc. This mod was created precisely to solve that problem!

### **Looking for more mod loaders support?**

Currently only supports NeoForge. Support for other mod loaders hasn't been decided yet. For Forge and Fabric 1.19.2 and 1.18.2, please refer to the original [WFB's Easy Commands](https://modrinth.com/mod/wfbs-ez-commands).
